# ReadingAndWritingProblems
Solutions to three separate problems that involve reading from files and subsequently writing to a file. This was my submission for the final assignment in an Algorithms and Data Structures class. 

> All three solutions were written in Java using Eclipse. Made by Nathan Ladd.

## Balloons
Consider a room full of balloons and arrows will be shot from the left end of a room and fly straight to the right end of the room at a height H. If an arrow hits a balloon, the arrow will go down to a height of H-1 in the next position and the balloon will be popped. This height will be maintained until it reaches the wall or hits another balloon. The balloon.java file will read an input file of balloon positions and output a file that has the number of arrows necessary to pop all of the balloons.
The input file has an integer n on line 1 that is the number of 'cases' in the file. Line 2 contains n integers mi separated by a space, each representing the total number of balloons of the ith  problem. Line 3 onwards has mi integers hj separated by a space, that are the respective heights of the jth balloon from left to right.
